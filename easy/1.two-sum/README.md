# Question's Summary

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```

  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

  Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
  return [0, 1].
  
```

# 思路

简单的题型，直接了当，双循环测试两个数相加是否等于 target
